    \section intro_sec Introduction

 The SimpleLink CC31XX/CC32XX family allows to add Wi-Fi and networking capabilities
 to low-cost embedded products without having prior Wi-Fi, RF or networking expertise.
 The CC31XX/CC32XX is an ideal solution for microcontroller-based sensor and control
 applications such as home appliances, home automation and smart metering.
 The CC31XX/CC32XX has integrated a comprehensive TCP/IP network stack, Wi-Fi driver and
 security supplicant leading to easier portability to microcontrollers, to an
 ultra-low memory footprint, all without compromising the capabilities and robustness
 of the final application.



 \section modules_sec Modules
 To make it simple, TI's SimpleLink CC31XX/CC32XX platform capabilities were divided into modules by topic (Silo). 
 These capabilities range from basic device management through wireless
 network configuration, standard BSD socket and much more.
 Listed below are the various modules in the SimpleLink CC31XX/CC32XX driver:
     -# \ref device - controls the behavior of the CC31XX/CC32XX device (start/stop, events masking and obtaining specific device status)
     -# \ref wlan - controls the use of the WiFi WLAN module including:
	   -# Connection features, such as: profiles, policies, SmartConfig
	   -# Advanced WLAN features, such as: scans, rx filters and rx statistics collection
     -# \ref socket - controls standard client/server sockets programming options and capabilities 
     -# \ref netapp - activates networking applications, such as: HTTP Server, DHCP Server, Ping, DNS and mDNS.
     -# \ref netcfg - controls the configuration of the device addresses (i.e. IP and MAC addresses)
     -# \ref fs     - provides file system capabilities to TI's CC31XX/CC32XX that can be used by both the CC31XX/CC32XX device and the user.


 \section 		porting_sec 	Porting

 The porting of the SimpleLink driver to any new platform is based on few simple steps.
 This guide takes you through this process step by step. Please follow the instructions
 carefully to avoid any problems during this process and to enable efficient and proper
 work with the device.
 Please notice that all modifications and porting adjustments of the driver should be
 made in the user.h header file only.
 Keep making any of the changes only in this file will ensure smoothly transaction to
 new versions of the driver at the future!


 \subsection 	porting_step1   Step 1 - Create your own user.h file

 The first step is to create a user.h file that will include your configurations and
 adjustments. You can use the empty template provided as part of this driver or
 you can choose to base your file on file from one of the wide range of examples
 applications provided by Texas Instruments


 \subsection    porting_step2   Step 2 - Select the capabilities set required for your application

 Texas Instruments made a lot of efforts to build set of predefined capability sets that would
 fit most of the target application.
 It is recommended to try and choose one of this predefined capabilities set before going to
 build your own customized set. If you find compatible set you can skip the rest of this step.

 The available sets are:
     -# SL_TINY     -   Compatible to be used on platforms with very limited resources. Provides
                        the best in class foot print in terms of Code and Data consumption.
     -# SL_SMALL    -   Compatible to most common networking applications. Provide the most
                        common APIs with decent balance between code size, data size, functionality
                        and performances
     -# SL_FULL     -   Provide access to all SimpleLink functionalities




 \subsection     porting_step3   Step 3 - Choose your memory management model

 The SimpleLink driver support two memory models:
     -# Static (default)
     -# Dynamic

 If you choose to work in dynamic model you will have to provide alloc and free functions
 to be used by the Simple Link driver otherwise nothing need to be done.


 \subsection     porting_step4   Step 4 - Set your asynchronous event handlers routines

 The SimpleLink device generate asynchronous events in several situations.
 These asynchronous events could be masked.
 In order to catch these events you have to provide handler routines.
 Please notice that if you not provide a handler routine and the event is received,
 the driver will drop this event without any indication of this drop.


\section	   ported_cc32xx	   Ported on CC32XX

\subsection    ported_cc32xx_step1   Interface communication driver

The SimpleLink device supports several standard communication protocol among SPI and
UART. CC32XX Host Driver implements SPI Communication Interface
The interface for this communication channel includes 4 simple access functions:
-# open
-# close
-# read
-# write

The way this driver would be implemented is directly effecting the efficiency and
the performances of the SimpleLink device on this platform.
In CC32XX, SPI implementation uses DMA in order to increase the utilization
of the communication channel

\subsection 	ported_cc32xx_step2	OS adaptation

The SimpleLink driver could run on two kind of platforms:
	-# Non-Os / Single Threaded (default)
	-# Multi-Threaded

CC32XX SimpleLink Host Driver is ported on Multi Threaded OS enviroment. The Host driver
is made OS independent by implementing an OS Abstraction layer. Reference implementation 
for OS Abstraction is available for FreeRTOS and TI-RTOS. 


If you choose to work in multi-threaded environment under different operating system you 
will have to provide some basic adaptation routines to allow the driver to protect access to 
resources for different threads (locking object) and to allow synchronization between threads 
(sync objects). In additional the driver support running without dedicated thread allocated solely
to the simple link driver. If you choose to work in this mode, you should also supply a spawn 
method that will enable to run function on a temporary context.
